<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On October 20 local time, Billboard announced that CxM&mdash;a new unit consisting of S.Coups and Mingyu&mdash;had made their debut on Billboard&rsquo;s Top 200 Albums chart, which ranks the most popular albums in the United States. For the week ending on October 25, the duo&rsquo;s unit debut mini album &ldquo;<a href="https://www.soompi.com/article/1770716wpp/watch-seventeens-s-coups-x-mingyu-announce-unit-debut-date-with-trailer-for-hype-vibes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HYPE VIBES</a>&rdquo; entered the Billboard 200 at No. 71.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this entry, CxM has achieved the highest ranking of any K-pop sub-unit in Billboard 200 history. The previous record, which remained unbeaten for over 13 years, belonged to Girls&rsquo; Generation&ndash;TTS&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://www.soompi.com/article/383790wpp/taetiseo-releases-music-video-for-twinkle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twinkle</a>&rdquo; (which peaked at No. 126 back in 2012).</p>
